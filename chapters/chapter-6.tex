\chapter{Plan of Action} \label{ch:planOfAction}

Here is a list of items what I plan to address going forward.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Only the first order upwind flux has been successfully implemented into libowski. I plan to implement the second order upwind flux approximation.
    \item Explore the mathematical properties of the transition matrix for the MSR depletion equation. This will include understanding the matrix norm and eigenvalues as a function of descretization. 
    \item Compute depletion calculations with larger number of isotopes. 
    \item Generate base solution to compare with my approximate solutions.
    \item Add mass transfer models for leaching, deposition and phase migration.
    \item Explore parallel computing methods for accelerated computation time.
    \item Compare against classical ODE integration methods.
    \item Implement nonlinear chemical kinetic models and solve general nonlinear PDE's. 
\end{itemize}
