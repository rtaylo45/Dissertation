\chapter{Plan of Action} \label{ch:planOfAction}

Here is a list of items what I plan to address going forward.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Only the first order upwind flux has been successfully implemented into libowski. I plan to implement the second order upwind flux approximation.
    \item Explore the mathematical properties of the transition matrix for the MSR depletion equation. This will include understanding the matrix norm and eigenvalues as a function of descritization. 
    \item Couple libowski to the ORIGIN depletion solver to run cases with MSR depletion calculations. 
    \item Develop a better understanding of the error analysis and propagation in the solution.
    \item Generate base matrix exponential solution to compare with my approximate solutions.
    \item Add mass transfer models for leaching, deposition and phase migration.
    \item Explore parallel computing methods for accelerated computation time
\end{itemize}
